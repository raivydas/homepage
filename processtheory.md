# Process Theory

## Course description

The course focuses on one aspect of Probability Theory - the theory of Stochastic Processes. These processes play an important part in modeling real world situations, such as the fluctuations of the profits of insurance companies over time. Specifically, we will study martingales, Poisson random measures, Lévy processes, Brownian motion, and Markov processes.
